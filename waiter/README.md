### Usage Notes

- Instance (named `instance-name` in the example) startup-script must signal back to the waiter (named `waiter` in the example), for example:

    ```sh
    gcloud beta runtime-config configs variables set \
        success/instance-name instance success --config-name $(ref.waiter.configName)
    ```

- The service account on the instance must be bound to a role with the `runtimeconfig.variables.create` action
    - Or if the default compute service account is in use, the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudruntimeconfig` scope should be applied

### Notes on Variable Exploitation for Template Outputs

Deployment Manager can acquire existing resources that allows Deployment Manager to acquire variables created after an instance has set them. This allows the template outputs to be dynamically generated by running commands on the instance. An example of this is in `examples/dynamic-outputs/vm.yaml`
